# AI vs ML vs DL
- AI : is a general field with a broad scope include
  - computer vision
  - language processing
  - creativity
  - etc...
- ML : is a branch of AI that cover the statistical part include
  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Neural Network
  - etc...
- DL : is a very special field of ML and it is a revolution of ML.




# Major Machine Learning techniques
- Regression/Estimation
  predicting continuous values
- Classification
  predicting the class/category of the case
- Clustering
  find the structure of the data and group similiar together
- Association
  associate frequent co-occurring items
- Anomaly Detection
  discover ubnormal and unusual cases
- Sequance mining
  predict next step
- Dimension Reduction
  reducting the size of the data (PCA)
- Recommendation System
  recommending items
