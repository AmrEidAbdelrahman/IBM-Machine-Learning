# AI vs ML vs DL
- AI : is a general field with a broad scope include
  - computer vision
  - language processing
  - creativity
  - etc...
- ML : is a branch of AI that cover the statistical part include
  - Regression
  - Classification
  - Neural Network
  - etc...
- DL : is a very special field of ML and it is a revolution of ML.




# Major Machine Learning techniques
- Regression/Estimation
  predicting continuous values
- Classification
  predicting the class/category of the case
- Clustering
  find the structure of the data and group similiar together
- Association
  associate frequent co-occurring items
- Anomaly Detection
  discover ubnormal and unusual cases
- Sequance mining
  predict next step
- Dimension Reduction
  reducting the size of the data (PCA)
- Recommendation System
  recommending items
  
  
# More about scikit-learn
- free software machine learning library
- have most of regression, classification abd clustering algorithms
- work with numpy and scipy
- have a great organized documentation
- easy to implemnet
- all phases of machine learning process are implemented including
  - Data preprocessing
  - Feature extraction
  - Feature Selection
  - Train/Test split
  - Algorithm setup
  - Model fitting
  - Prediction
  - Evaluation
  - Model export
  
# Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- supervised : we teach the model, then with that knowledge, it can predict unknown or future instance. (Classification and Regression)
  - Labeled Data
  - Has more evaluation models that unsupervised learning
  - controlled environment
- unsupervised : the model work on its own to discover information. (Clustering, Dimension Reduction and Density estimation)
  - Unlabeled Data
  - have fewer evaluation models that supervised learning
  - less controlled environment

## what is Classification ?
Classification is the proess of predicting discrete class label.

## what is Regression ?
Regression is the process of predicting continupus values.

## What is Clustering ?
Clustering is consedered to be the most popular unsupervised machine learning techniques use for grouping data point or object that is some how similar.
used in :
  - Discovering structure
  - Summerization
  - Anomaly detection


# Regression
regression have two main variable X:Independent Variable and Y:Dependet Variable
X:Idependent Variable also known as Explantory variable is the causes of the target variable.
Y:Dependent Variable is the target variable, we study and try to predict.
in regression, The Y:Dependent variable have to be continuouse not discrete/categorical.
#### Type of Regression
- Simple Linear Regression
  - simple Linear regression
  - Simple Non-linear regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear regression
  - Multiple Non-linear regression
#### Regression algorithms
- Ordinal Regression
- Poisson Regression
- Fast forest quantile regression
- linear, polynomial, Lasso, Stepwise, Ridge regression
- Bayesian linear regression
- Newural network regression
- Decision forest regression
- Boosted decision tree regression
- KNN (K-nearest neighbors)
